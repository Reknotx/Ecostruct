Theme: Repair.

Premise: You are a little robot that is tasked with cleaning up the world of all of the pollution that's
dirtied the planet in order to make room for trees to grow and reclaim the ecosystem. 

I handled all of the programming for the game while my partner handled the artistic parts of the game.
Programmed in is a spread mechanic for the pollution which slowly takes over the map if left unchecked.
Gameplay mechanics such as movement and cleaning of tiles were also coded in.
